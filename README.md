<b>Sol-Patreon</b> is a dApp (Decentralized application) that allows a decentralized way for creators to get paid for creating content for their fans. It helps creators to accept support and membership from their fans. It supports more than 5 wallets and each one of them provide a pretty easy way to do the transaction. To create your profile on the blockchain and to our platform, all you will need is a wallet and some SOL. If you dont have an wallet you can
create one from [here](https://phantom.app/)

## Why it was made:

The idea came when we were exploring projects particularly ones that gives support to creators that can connect to their fans in better way. The reason for us to create it on solana was for the most secure process for the creators to have their content, we choose Solana so to help them with what they deserve and make a platform easy and user-friendly so that we can support creators who has some content for which they can get paid. If you also want to get started about Solana, you can find the resources I used to create one dApp from [here](https://github.com/cdhiraj40/SolanaxLeetDroid/blob/master/RESOURCES.md).

## What it does :

This project "<b>Sol-Patreon/b>" provides builders, creators, and simply people who want to connect with their fans to create a profile to add their pay-based content in their profile section with a sol pay account and the ones who would like to donate would simply do without creating their account contribute to the creator. This makes transactions easy and effective. It lets user to connect with their creator via a simple UI. To donate any creator
you have to connect to your wallet. The dApp provides more than 5 wallets and once you are connected you can create your profile and add into blockchain under 10 seconds. Yes its that fast!(Read more about Solana from [here](https://solana.com/news/getting-started-with-solana-development). if you still face any issues feel free to create an issue, I would love to help.
